# 1. Supervised learning 

Very popular today.
Learns from examples/ right answers.
Learns by from correct examples.

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained using labeled data, meaning each input has a known correct output.  
The model learns the relationship between inputs and outputs so it can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

## a. Regression

Regression is a type of supervised learning where the output is **continuous**, meaning it can take infinitely many possible values within a range. The predicted outcome is typically a number, such as house price, temperature, or sales revenue.

## Unsupervised learning 

Data is not associated with output label. 
Find something interesting in the unlabeled data.
