c. Authentication and Session Management Issues  
d. Insecure Deserialization  
e. Sensitive Data Exposure  
f. XML External Entity (XXE) Attacks  
g. Broken Access Control  
h. Security Misconfiguration (including missing security headers)  
i. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)  
j. Security Misconfiguration  

These represent the **most critical web security risks**.
