## API Design

We will be using REST APIs
![[Pasted image 20250919124707.png]]

**REST API** stands for **Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface**. It‚Äôs a way for two software systems to communicate with each other over the internet, usually using **HTTP** (the same protocol your browser uses to load web pages).

Here‚Äôs the idea:

### 1. **Resources and Endpoints**

- In REST, everything is treated as a **resource** (like users, matches, messages in a Tinder example).
- Each resource has a unique **URL (endpoint)**.
    - Example:
        - `GET /users/123` ‚Üí fetch user with ID 123
        - `POST /users` ‚Üí create a new user

### 2. **HTTP Methods (CRUD)**

REST APIs use standard HTTP verbs to define actions:
- **GET** ‚Üí Read (fetch data)
- **POST** ‚Üí Create (add data)
- **PUT/PATCH** ‚Üí Update (modify data)
- **DELETE** ‚Üí Remove data

So if Tinder had an API:

- `GET /matches` ‚Üí get your matches
- `POST /swipes` ‚Üí create a new swipe
- `DELETE /swipes/456` ‚Üí delete swipe with ID 456
### 3. **Stateless**

- REST is **stateless** ‚Üí every request from a client to the server must contain all the info needed (like auth token, user ID).
- The server does not remember your "state" between requests.

### 4. **Data Format**

- REST usually returns data in **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation), sometimes XML.
- Example response:
`{   "user_id": 123,   "name": "Akshith",   "age": 24 }`

### 5. **Scalability**
- Because it‚Äôs stateless and uses simple HTTP, REST APIs scale really well ‚Äî perfect for apps like Tinder.


## PUT vs PATCH

### üîπ **PUT**
- **Meaning**: Replace the entire resource with the new representation you send.
- If a field is missing, it is usually assumed to be **removed or reset**.
- Think of it like overwriting the entire object.

### üîπ **PATCH**
- **Meaning**: Partial update of a resource.
- Only the fields you include are updated; others remain unchanged.
- Think of it like a targeted modification.

![[Pasted image 20250920013621.png]]

MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
1. Major version (X.0.0)
Breaking changes.

Updating to a new major version may break backward compatibility (your old code may stop working).

Example:

4.x.x ‚Üí 5.0.0 could change APIs, remove functions, or alter behavior.

2. Minor version (x.Y.0)
New features added, but backward compatible.

Existing code should keep working.

Example:

4.17.1 ‚Üí 4.18.0 might add a new helper function or config option, but won‚Äôt break your old code.

3. Patch version (x.x.Z)
Bug fixes, performance improvements, or small tweaks.

No new features, just stability fixes.

Always backward compatible.

Example:

4.17.1 ‚Üí 4.17.2 fixes a security issue or small bug.

4. Backward Compatibility
Means new versions won‚Äôt break old code.

Minor + patch updates preserve backward compatibility.

Major updates can break it.

üëâ For example,
if your project depends on express@^4.17.1:

‚úÖ Allowed: 4.17.2, 4.18.0, 4.19.5

‚ùå Not allowed: 5.0.0 (because it may break old apps).
