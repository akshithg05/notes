## API Design

We will be using REST APIs
![[Pasted image 20250919124707.png]]

**REST API** stands for **Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface**. Itâ€™s a way for two software systems to communicate with each other over the internet, usually using **HTTP** (the same protocol your browser uses to load web pages).

Hereâ€™s the idea:

### 1. **Resources and Endpoints**

- In REST, everything is treated as a **resource** (like users, matches, messages in a Tinder example).
- Each resource has a unique **URL (endpoint)**.
    - Example:
        - `GET /users/123` â†’ fetch user with ID 123
        - `POST /users` â†’ create a new user

### 2. **HTTP Methods (CRUD)**

REST APIs use standard HTTP verbs to define actions:
- **GET** â†’ Read (fetch data)
- **POST** â†’ Create (add data)
- **PUT/PATCH** â†’ Update (modify data)
- **DELETE** â†’ Remove data

So if Tinder had an API:

- `GET /matches` â†’ get your matches
- `POST /swipes` â†’ create a new swipe
- `DELETE /swipes/456` â†’ delete swipe with ID 456
### 3. **Stateless**

- REST is **stateless** â†’ every request from a client to the server must contain all the info needed (like auth token, user ID).
- The server does not remember your "state" between requests.

### 4. **Data Format**

- REST usually returns data in **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation), sometimes XML.
- Example response:
`{   "user_id": 123,   "name": "Akshith",   "age": 24 }`

### 5. **Scalability**
- Because itâ€™s stateless and uses simple HTTP, REST APIs scale really well â€” perfect for apps like Tinder.


## PUT vs PATCH

### ðŸ”¹ **PUT**
- **Meaning**: Replace the entire resource with the new representation you send.
- If a field is missing, it is usually assumed to be **removed or reset**.
- Think of it like overwriting the entire object.

### ðŸ”¹ **PATCH**
- **Meaning**: Partial update of a resource.
- Only the fields you include are updated; others remain unchanged.
- Think of it like a targeted modification.
