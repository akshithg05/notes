## 4. Introduction to Computational Psychometry

- Psychometry is the measurement and testing of human intelligence
- Computational psychometry uses computational models to study human cognition
- AI agents are treated as models of human thinking
- Agent performance is analyzed to gain insights into cognition


## 5. Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RPM) in This Course

- The original RPM project description is retained because it provides a broad justification for testing AI systems against humans using intelligence tests
- RPM problems will be used as examples throughout later topics in the course

# ARC AGI

## ARC-AGI Benchmark (Relation to RPM)

- **ARC-AGI** is a benchmark focused on **general intelligence**, particularly **abstract and spatial reasoning**.
    
- Problems require discovering **implicit rules** from a few examples and applying them to new cases.
    
- The tasks emphasize **reasoning and generalization**, not memorization or scale.
    

## Key Characteristics

- Strong emphasis on **spatial reasoning** and pattern abstraction
    
- Very **few training examples** per task
    
- No fixed input size or predefined feature space
    
- Requires forming hypotheses about underlying rules
    

## Human vs AI Performance

- **Humans significantly outperform current AI systems** on ARC-AGI tasks
    
- No existing AI system comes close to **human-level performance** on this benchmark
    
- Humans solve these problems with:
    
    - fewer examples
        
    - less computation
        
    - better generalization
        

## Cost and Scalability Issues

- Even the most sophisticated models:
    
    - require **very large numbers of parameters**
        
    - are **computationally expensive**
        
    - still perform poorly relative to humans
        
- Increasing model size leads to **high cost** without proportional gains in reasoning ability
    

## Why ARC-AGI Matters for This Course

- Highlights the gap between **pattern learning** and **true reasoning**
    
- Shows the limitations of purely data-driven approaches
    
- Aligns with the **knowledge-based perspective** of intelligence
    
- Reinforces why tasks like RPM are useful for studying cognition
    

---

### One-line takeaway

ARC-AGI exposes how far modern AI still is from human-like abstract and spatial reasoning, even with massive computational resources.
