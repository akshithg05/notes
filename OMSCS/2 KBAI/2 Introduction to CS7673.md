## 1. Class Goals

- Core methods of Knowledge-Based AI
- Tasks addressed by Knowledge-Based AI
- How KBAI agents use these methods to solve tasks
- Relationship between AI and human cognition

## 2. Class Outcomes

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

- Design and implement a Knowledge-Based AI agent
- Apply KBAI strategies to solve complex, practical problems
- Use the design and behavior of AI agents to reflect on human cognition

## 3. Class Strategies

- Learning by example
- Learning by doing
- Project-based learning
- Personalization
- Learning by reflection

## 4. Introduction to Computational Psychometry

- Psychometry is the measurement and testing of human intelligence
- Computational psychometry uses computational models to study human cognition
- AI agents are treated as models of human thinking
- Agent performance is analyzed to gain insights into cognition


## 5. Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RPM) in This Course

- The original RPM project description is retained because it provides a broad justification for testing AI systems against humans using intelligence tests
- RPM problems will be used as examples throughout later topics in the course
