It is a problem solving method. Another item in the fundamental topics

It is very simple. Problem -> potential solutions -> test solutions
If we have complete and correct knowledge this is not required.

We can generate potential and plausible methods and then test them. That is the whole USP of generate and test method.

Which of these will be redundant


### Dumb Generators - Dumb testers

This is because we have many states which is same as the initial states. Because of dumb generators and testers we are getting this. This method applied iteratively can lead to the final state but it will computationally very costly. Too many iterations. It is a powerful method but we have to be careful as to use it wisely as brute force might lead to costly operations.
