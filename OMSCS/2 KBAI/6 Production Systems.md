# Cognitive Architecture – Production Systems

## Memory Structure
Production systems use **two main types of memory**:
- **Working Memory**
- **Long-Term Memory**

---

## Working Memory
- Holds **current, active information**
- Represents the **current state of the world**
- Used during **reasoning and decision-making**
- Changes dynamically as rules are applied

> *What the system is thinking about right now*

---

## Long-Term Memory
Stores **persistent knowledge** and is relatively stable.  
It has **three components**:

### Procedural Memory
- Stores **procedural (how-to) knowledge**
- Encoded as **IF–THEN production rules**
- Controls actions and behavior

**Example:**  
- IF holding a jug and the glass is empty → THEN pour water

> *Knowing how to do something*

---

### Semantic Memory
- Stores **general facts, concepts, and relationships**
- Independent of personal experience
- Represents structured world knowledge

**Example:**  
- A jug can hold water  
- Water is a liquid

> *Knowing that something is true*

---

### Episodic Memory
- Stores **past experiences or events**
- Contextual and time-specific
- Useful for recalling previous situations

**Example:**  
- Last time I poured water, the glass overflowed

> *Remembering what happened*

---

## Key Insight
- **Working Memory** = current situation
- **Long-Term Memory** = accumulated knowledge
- Intelligent behavior emerges from their interaction
