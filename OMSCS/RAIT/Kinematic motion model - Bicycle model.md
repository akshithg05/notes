The front wheel is movable and makes an angle alpha with the horizontal. first image is positive alpha and 2nd image is negative alpha

The rear wheel is fixed and forward distance is measured from the rear wheel to rear wheel.

In the above graph, robot A and C have the same orientation, Robot D and E have the same location, robot B and E have the same orientation.
None of the robots have the same pose. (combination of direction and orientation).
