## ⭐ Interview-Ready Answer (WCAG & Accessibility)

**“In our web application, we’ve actively followed WCAG ()  accessibility guidelines to ensure the product is usable by users with assistive technologies and diverse accessibility needs.”**

**“At a basic level, we ensured that all non-text content is accessible.”**

- Added **meaningful alternative text** for all images and icons so screen readers can correctly interpret them.
    
- For decorative icons, we used appropriate ARIA attributes to prevent unnecessary noise for screen reader users.
    

**“We also focused on semantic structure and assistive technology support.”**

- Used **semantic HTML elements** wherever possible instead of generic divs.
    
- Added proper **ARIA roles, labels, and landmarks** to help screen readers understand page structure and component intent.
    

**“Keyboard accessibility was another important focus.”**

- Ensured that all interactive elements are **fully keyboard navigable**.
    
- Maintained a **logical tab order** and visible focus states for buttons, links, and form elements.
    

**“From a usability and compliance standpoint, we also addressed visual accessibility.”**

- Maintained sufficient **color contrast** between text and background.
    
- Avoided using color as the sole indicator of status or errors.
    

**“Finally, we validated accessibility during development.”**

- Tested with **screen readers** and browser accessibility tools.
    
- Used automated tools like **Lighthouse / axe** as part of our quality checks.

Lighthouse and Axe are ==powerful, complementary web accessibility tools==: **Lighthouse**, built into Chrome DevTools, offers broad audits (Perf, SEO, PWA, Accessibility) giving an overall score, while **axe (Deque Systems)** provides deep, rules-based accessibility checks, often used via its browser extension or DevTools panel, catching complex issues Lighthouse might miss and detailing failures with fixes. Lighthouse _uses_ axe-core for its accessibility checks, but the standalone axe extension offers more granular inspection, highlighting failing nodes directly.
