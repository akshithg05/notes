# Setting Up TypeScript for Production — Notes

## Initializing TypeScript
To set up TypeScript in a project, we run:

    tsc --init

This command creates a `tsconfig.json` file.  
This file is used to configure all TypeScript-related settings for the project, such as target version, strictness, output directory, and more.

---

## Using TypeScript with HTML
In production, browsers do **not** understand TypeScript.  
So in `index.html`, we always point the `<script src="">` to a **JavaScript file**, not a `.ts` file.

The JavaScript file is the output generated by TypeScript after compilation.

---

## Output Directory (`outDir`)
In `tsconfig.json`, we usually specify an `outDir` (for example, `dist/`).  
TypeScript compiles `.ts` files and places the generated `.js` files into this directory.

This keeps:
- source TypeScript files separate
- compiled JavaScript files cleanly organized

---

## Watch Mode
To continuously compile TypeScript while developing, we use **watch mode**:

    tsc index.ts -w

In watch mode:
- TypeScript keeps watching the file
- Any change in `index.ts` automatically generates `index.js`
- The output JavaScript file is placed in the configured `outDir` (e.g., `dist/`)

---

## Key Idea
TypeScript is mainly a **development tool for type safety**.  
We write TypeScript during development, but the application always runs on the compiled JavaScript output.

---

## Summary
- `tsc --init` creates the TypeScript config file
- Browsers load only compiled `.js` files
- `outDir` controls where JS output is generated
- Watch mode (`-w`) recompiles automatically on changes
- Production always runs JavaScript, not TypeScript
